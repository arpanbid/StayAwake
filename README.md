StayAwake

Description
The Stay Awake App is a Python script that prevents your PC from entering sleep mode. It achieves this by sending a simulated Control key press every 30 seconds, effectively keeping your system awake.

Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Download the StayAwake.py script from this repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using the following command:
python3 StayAwake.py

The script will start sending Control key presses at regular intervals, preventing your PC from going to sleep.

Customization
You can adjust the interval (30 seconds by default) by modifying the sleep(30) function in the script.

Disclaimer
Use this app responsibly and be aware that keeping your PC awake for extended periods may impact power consumption and system performance.
